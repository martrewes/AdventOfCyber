# Advent of Cyber 2020 Log

>Advent of Cyber is an event aimed at helping users get started with cyber security, by releasing beginner friendly security exercises every day leading up to Christmas.
>
>We know that Security can be a daunting field. It can be very difficult for beginners to take the jump and get started with learning just a small part of security!
>
>For 25 days we will release tasks breaking down common security topics into byte-sized walkthroughs and challenges.

>Each task will be self contained and will include the basic information required to start working on a challenge - We won't be throwing you in the deep end! The challenge will contain supporting material about that particular topic to ensure that you're actually learning.

In this repository is just a log I decided to keep whilst doing the Advent of Cyber room on TryHackMe *(I know I'm far too late)*. It is my first attempt at doing anything at all like this, but I thought it would be a good introduction into pentesting and forensics as that has always been an interest of mine. 

I will attempt to do one a day, however due to the event ending a while ago, I do not feel I am rushed for time. I may complete it sooner, who knows?
